	Unique Jabber-ID.

	A JID is made up of a node (generally a username), a domain, and a resource.

		jid             = [ node "@" ] domain [ "/" resource ]
		domain          = fqdn / address-literal
		fqdn            = (sub-domain 1*("." sub-domain))
		sub-domain      = (internationalized domain label)
		address-literal = IPv4address / IPv6address

	Each allowable portion of a JID (node, domain, and resource) must not be more than 1023 bytes in length,
	resulting in a maximum total size (including the '@' and '/' separators) of 3071 bytes.
